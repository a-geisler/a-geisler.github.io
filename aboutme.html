        <p class= "aboutme">So, as you know, my name is Aaron. I'm a father, a husband, and an avid outdoorsman. My wife Meghan and I, as well as our daughter Olivia Mae enjoy our free time as a family - hiking, camping, riding our bikes, and plenty of time at the playground! Our 11 year old labrador mix named Duncan can be found tagging along on most of our adventures. Before parenthood, my wife and I were professional wedding, engagement, and portrait photographers, which has taught me to learn creativity, and some design. I myself am analytical, data driven, and sometimes too organized as my wife likes to claim. A big "techy" if you will, have always been into computers, devices, and how they work.</p>

       <p class= "careerparagraph">Eager to begin my career in Web Development, starting with the user experience side working as a Front End Engineer, while learning JavaScript. Excited to make my work more and more interactive on my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. Inspired by seeing how things come together as I imagine them, by using my current HTML / CSS knowledge, and my creative background in photography.</p>
